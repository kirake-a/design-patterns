# Abstract Factory

## Pros
* You can be sure that the products you're getting from a factory are compatible with each other

* You avoid tight coupling between concrete products and client code.

## Cons
* The code may become more complicated than it should be, since a lot of new interfaces and classes are introduced along with the pattern.
